My First Robot Framework automation test with python. 

Test spec step
- Search item with keyword TV 
- Filter TV with screen size 
- Add item into cart 
- Checkout cart and validate item sohuld be match with selected item

Pros: 
- Easy install and setup project 
- Easy to understand and implement 
- Easy to understand log and error message

Cons:
- Need more time to walk through all the selenium library keyword.
- Take time to open browser and do the action step by step impact test run time.
- A bit flaky. Require to insert waituntil and sleep for some second to reduce flakyness.

Improvement:
- Website should provide more data element of locator
- Some step has limitation to select and evalute value due to xpath 
- Make code to be better and easy understand
- Add more information for better log

Please kindly submit comment for better version.
